### Lots of different backgrounds here!

# Why are you here? Why R? Why now?

---

# Why should you learn R?

* R is free, R improves, R has existed for a long time
* Students can show what they have learned to a potential employer easily
* The support system for R is actually very good!
  * Many free textbooks online
  * Tons of announcements and content on Twitter
  * [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for coding questions

# But why should YOU learn R?

* R and R Markdown will save you TONS of time. Long term thinking is key.

--

  * You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
  
--

  * Remembering what drop-down menu something is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
  
--

  * Remembering to copy-and-paste your updated plots/analysis into your word processor is a pain and error prone

# Good Coding Habits


* [Good coding style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) -- Use a consistent style!

--

* Use some form of Git

--

* Take advantage of R Markdown, R Shiny, and R projects where appropriate

--

.center[*Reproducibility is key!*]

# What this workshop is

* Some of...

.center[![](https://paulvanderlaken.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/tidyverse1.png)]

* Plus a few others: rmarkdown, shiny, and your advanced topics

---

# Let's Get Started

* [Installing R](https://www.r-project.org/)

  * Follow the "Getting Started" directions to download and install R
  
--

* [Installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

  * Click on "RStudio Desktop" and follow the directions to download and install the **open source edition** of RStudio Desktop
  
---

# Collecting the workshop materials

* Open RStudio

* In the Console pane (bottom left or just left by default) type the following and hit Enter

.center[**install.packages("usethis")**]

* Now, in the same Console pane, type the following and hit Enter

.center[**usethis code here**]

* On your desktop you should see a new folder titled "rworkshop"

* Open that "rworkshop" folder and open (double-click) the "rworkshop.Rproj" file (it should have a light blue icon with an R in the middle of it)

* You should see RStudio come to the front of your screen except now, in the very top right corner of RStudio, you should see that light blue icon next to **rworkshop**

---

# What did we just do?!

* You installed Base R

* You installed RStudio

* You installed your first package: `usethis`

* You obtained all of our workshop materials (to your Desktop) via some functionality of the `usethis` package

* You opened an R project file called *rworkshop* (more on this later)

---

# Working with R through RStudio

* R is the language

--

* RStudio is the IDE (integrated development environment) -- not required to work with R, but highly recommended

--

# Basic Ways to Use R

1. In the Console Pane

  * Try `2 + 2` and hit Enter

--

2. In an R script (.R) file

  * File -> New File -> R Script
  
--

  * Type `2 + 2` in your script, select/highlight it, and then hit Ctrl + Enter

---

# R Markdown

* File -> New File -> R Markdown

  * "Document" and "HTML" are fine for now, but you can see we have many options for output types
  
--

* This file looks very different!

  * The symbol (at the top of the pane) and file extension are different than an R script

  * There appears to be header information
  
  * There appear to be gray and white chunks throughout the file

---

# Fresh R Markdown Activity

* In your new R Markdown file, do and answer the following with your neighbors:

  * Save this file to your desktop as `rmarkdownactivity_lastname` with your last name inserted. You can use either the File menu or the little save icon at the top of the R Markdown file.
  
  * What do you think the differences are between the white chunks and the gray chunks?
  
  * What happens when you click the green play button on the right side of the second gray chunk from the top? What about for the last gray chunk?
  
  * What happens when you click the "Knit" icon at the top of the R Markdown file? Can you trace all of the things you're seeing produced back to the R Markdown file?
  
  * In the last gray chunk, change `echo = FALSE` to `echo = TRUE` and then click the green play button for that chunk again. What changed? Click the "Knit" icon again and observe the result. What changed?

# Fresh R Markdown Activity "Answers"

* Gray chunks contain code that can be run. White chunks contain (markdown) text. The interweaving of these two means that we can create dynamic reports seamlessly in a single location/file!

--

* Each gray chunk can be thought of as a mini R script file. You can highlight only portions of code in a chunk to run via *Ctrl + Enter* or you can run the whole chunk via that green play button. Results appear in-line, i.e. beneath each code chunk.

--

* Knitting an R Markdown file means "running" the code/markdown within and producing the corresponding output file (HTML, PDF, Word). Yours should have produced an HTML file. While the result popped up for you in a separate RStudio window, the resulting HTML file is produced in the same location as your R Markdown file (check your Desktop!).

--

* There are vast number of features and customizability options to take advantage for both the R Markdown and the resulting files (e.g. `echo`)!

# Some Toy Work with `iris`

* Canonical `iris` dataset 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
as_tibble(iris) %>%
  head()
```

--

* Close out of your current RStudio session (*X* in the top right)

* Open up the *rworkshop* folder on your desktop

* Navigate to the *day1* subfolder

* Open up the *toyworkiris.Rmd* file (this should open a new RStudio session)

* Read and work your way through this file

---

# `iris` Work Follow-Up

* Amongst other things, you just made some changes to the `iris` dataset and saved them in `myiris`

* Suppose you wanted to save these changes as a new dataset that you could share with others, in a new file called `myiris.csv`

* You could accomplish this with the following code (do not run this code):

.center[`write_csv(myiris, "myiris.csv")`]

--

* Where will this file get created on your machine? How could we change where the file gets created?

--

* Let's keep things as reproducible as possible!

.center[**R projects**]

# R Projects

* Projects for your R work!

* Fantastic organizational tool

--

* Close out of all of your current RStudio sessions

* Open up the `rworkshop` folder on your desktop

* Open the `rworkshop` R project file (light blue square icon with `R` in the middle)

* Locate your working directory path at the top of the Console pane

```{r, out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

# Fresh R Project Activity

* Create a new folder on your Desktop called `rworkshop_myproject`

* In RStudio, File -> New Project

  * Select `Existing Directory`
  
  * Browse to your Desktop and select your newly created `rworkshop_myproject` folder
  
  * Click `Create Project`
  
* Start a new R Markdown file

  * Do a few things of your choosing, possibly with the `iris` dataset if you like
  
  * Knit the file
  
* Navigate to your `rworkshop_myproject` folder and confirm that your new R Markdown and resulting HTML file are within along with the project file itself
